## The Structure (60 Minutes)

| Time | Focus Area | Purpose |
|:---:|:---|:---|
| **0-10 min** | Personal Pulse & Life | Build the human connection first |
| **10-30 min** | Their Agenda | Address blockers and priorities |
| **30-50 min** | Self-Reflection & Career | Growth-focused "Mirrors" |
| **50-60 min** | Feedback & Actions | Bi-directional improvement |

### 0-10 min: Personal Pulse & Life

> *Build the human connection first.*

**Opening Question:**
- "How are you *actually* doing?"

**Why it matters:** People aren't just employees—they're humans with lives outside work. Starting here builds trust and psychological safety.

---

### 10-30 min: Their Agenda

> *Their meeting, their priorities.*

**Key Questions:**
- "What's on your mind?"
- "What blockers are in your way?"

**Manager's Role:** Listen more than you speak. Take notes. Remove obstacles.

---

### 30-50 min: Self-Reflection & Career

> *Focus on the "Mirrors"*

Help your team member see themselves clearly through reflection:

| Mirror Type | Sample Question |
|:---|:---|
| **Reflection** | "What achievement are you most proud of this month?" |
| **Gap Analysis** | "What skill did you feel was missing during that last incident?" |
| **Motivation** | "On a scale of 1-10, how much ownership do you feel over [Feature X]?" |

---

### 50-60 min: Feedback & Actions

> *Bi-directional feedback.*

**For Them:**
- Specific, actionable feedback on recent work
- Recognition of wins

**For You:**
- "What could I have done better to support you last week?"
- "How can I help you succeed in the coming sprint?"

**Close with:** Clear action items with owners and deadlines.

## Reflection Question Bank

Use these powerful questions to spark deeper conversations:

### Empowerment
> "If you were the tech lead for a day, what's the first process you would delete?"

### Ownership
> "What's the one thing in our codebase you feel most 'responsible' for? Why?"

### Self-Improvement
> "What is one thing you learned this week that you'd like to teach the rest of the team?"
