# Onboarding Philosophy

> **From Passive Checklist to Active Ownership**

A modern approach to onboarding that empowers teams to own the process and accelerates new hire productivity through structured pair programming.

## The Ownership Model

Instead of a top-down checklist, the team maintains a `ONBOARDING_LIVING_DOC.md`.

| Role | Responsibility |
|:---|:---|
| **Lead's Role** | Provide the boundaries (Security, HR, Tooling access) |
| **Team's Role** | Define the "Social Fabric" (How we communicate, celebrate, handle 'silent' hours) |

## The "4-Week High-Touch" Rule

> To ensure a new hire doesn't just read docs, we mandate a **4-Week Pair Programming Immersion**.

### Week-by-Week Progression

| Week | Driver | Navigator | Focus |
|:---:|:---|:---|:---|
| **1** | Mentor | New Hire | Environment, local setup, and "Why" behind the architecture |
| **2** | New Hire | Mentor | First bug fix/small feature, PR process, CI/CD flow |
| **3** | Rotating | Rotating | Different coding styles and sub-systems |
| **4** | New Hire | Team | Autonomy check-new hire leads a session |

---

## The Philosophy in Action

```
Week 1          Week 2          Week 3          Week 4
──────          ──────          ──────          ──────

OBSERVE    →    PRACTICE    →    EXPAND     →    LEAD

Mentor          New Hire        Rotating        New Hire
Drives          Drives          Pairs           Leads

"Watch me"      "Try it"        "Meet everyone" "Show us"
```

## Key Principles

1. **Learning by Doing** - Documentation supports, but doesn't replace, hands-on experience
2. **Psychological Safety** - It's okay to make mistakes in the first 4 weeks
3. **Relationship Building** - Technical skills matter, but so do team connections
4. **Gradual Autonomy** - Structured handoff from guidance to independence
