> **A guide to working effectively with Vadym Shukurov.**

This document exists to accelerate our working relationship. It's my attempt at radical transparency about how I operate, what I value, and how you can get the best out of our collaboration.

---

## TL;DR

| Aspect | My Default |
|:---|:---|
| **Communication** | Direct, async-first, written > verbal |
| **Meetings** | Agenda required, decisions documented |
| **Feedback** | Give it early, give it often |
| **Decisions** | Data-informed, bias toward action |
| **Trust** | High trust by default, autonomy earned |

---

## My Leadership Philosophy

### What I Believe

- **People over process** - Frameworks serve people, not the other way around
- **Autonomy with accountability** - Freedom to decide, ownership of outcomes
- **Progress over perfection** - Ship, learn, iterate
- **Transparency by default** - Bad news early, good news shared
- **Systems thinking** - Fix the system, not the symptom

### My Job

1. **Remove blockers** - Clear the path so you can do your best work
2. **Provide context** - Share the "why" behind decisions and priorities
3. **Develop people** - Help you grow faster than you would alone
4. **Set direction** - Align the team toward meaningful outcomes
5. **Protect focus** - Shield the team from unnecessary noise

## Communication Preferences

### How to Reach Me

| Channel | Use For | Response Time |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Slack DM** | Quick questions, FYIs | Within a few hours |
| **Slack Channel** | Team discussions, decisions | Same day |
| **Email** | External, formal, or long-form | Within 24 hours |
| **Scheduled Call** | Complex topics, 1:1s, sensitive matters | As scheduled |
| **Unscheduled Call** | True emergencies only | Immediate |

### My Communication Style

**What you'll notice:**
- I write a lot-it's how I think
- I ask clarifying questions-I want to understand before I advise
- I'm direct-I say what I mean, no hidden agendas
- I default to async-interruptions are expensive

**What I need from you:**
- Lead with context-"Here's the situation, here's what I need"
- Be specific-vague concerns get vague responses
- Tell me the ask-are you venting, seeking advice, or need a decision?

## Working With Me

### Things I Value

| Value | What It Looks Like |
|:---|:---|
| **Ownership** | You drive outcomes, not just tasks |
| **Curiosity** | You ask "why" and dig deeper |
| **Honesty** | You tell me the truth, even when it's hard |
| **Follow-through** | You do what you say you'll do |
| **Growth mindset** | You treat failures as learning opportunities |

### Things That Frustrate Me

| Frustration | Why It Matters |
|:---|:---|
| **Surprises** | Bad news late is worse than bad news early |
| **Learned helplessness** | Bring solutions, not just problems |
| **Politics** | I have zero tolerance for hidden agendas |
| **Perfectionism** | Done is better than perfect |
| **Silence** | If you're stuck, say so |

---

## How I Give Feedback

- **Frequently** - Small feedback often beats big feedback rarely
- **Directly** - I'll tell you what I think, clearly and kindly
- **Privately** - Constructive feedback happens 1:1, not in public
- **With examples** - I'll be specific about what I observed
- **With care** - My goal is your growth, not criticism

### The SBI Model I Use

| Component | Example |
|:---|:---|
| **Situation** | "In yesterday's sprint planning..." |
| **Behavior** | "...you interrupted the PM twice while they were speaking..." |
| **Impact** | "...which made it harder for them to finish their thought and may have discouraged others from sharing." |

---

## How I Want to Receive Feedback

**Please give me feedback.** I mean it.

### What Works

- Be direct-don't soften it so much I miss the point
- Be timely-tell me soon after the event
- Be specific-"That meeting felt unproductive" is less useful than "The meeting ran over because we didn't have a clear agenda"
- Tell me in private first-I'll take it better

### What I'm Working On

Areas I'm actively trying to improve:

- **Patience** - I can move too fast and leave people behind
- **Delegation** - I sometimes jump in when I should let others lead
- **Listening** - I occasionally formulate responses before you finish talking

---

## My Quirks

Things you'll notice if you work with me:

| Quirk | Context |
|:---|:---|
| **I think out loud** | My first idea isn't always my final position-push back |
| **I love whiteboards** | Complex problems need visual thinking |
| **I protect mornings** | Deep work happens before noon; meetings after |
| **I take notes** | If I'm writing, I'm engaged, not distracted |
| **I ask "why" a lot** | It's curiosity, not interrogation |

---

## 1:1s With Me

### What to Expect

- **Your meeting** - You set the agenda, I adapt
- **60 minutes** - Enough time for real conversation
- **Weekly cadence** - Consistency builds trust
- **Private** - What we discuss stays between us

### What I'll Ask

- What's on your mind?
- What's blocking you?
- What do you need from me?
- What should I know that I might not?

### What I Hope You'll Share

- Wins worth celebrating
- Concerns before they become problems
- Feedback on how I can support you better
- Career aspirations and growth areas

---

## Decision-Making

### How I Make Decisions

1. **Gather context** - Data, perspectives, constraints
2. **Identify options** - What are the trade-offs?
3. **Consult stakeholders** - Who needs to weigh in?
4. **Decide** - Bias toward action over analysis paralysis
5. **Communicate** - Share the what and the why
6. **Iterate** - Revisit if new information emerges

### My Decision Framework

| Reversibility | Impact | Approach |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Easy to reverse | Low | Decide quickly, empower others |
| Easy to reverse | High | Decide quickly, communicate broadly |
| Hard to reverse | Low | Take time, but don't overthink |
| Hard to reverse | High | Deliberate carefully, consult widely |

## What Success Looks Like

- You have clarity on expectations and priorities
- You feel empowered to make decisions
- You trust me to have your back

### For Our Team

- We ship value consistently

## Final Thought

> **"I succeed when you succeed. My job is to create the conditions for your best work."**

This document is a living artifact. If something here doesn't match your experience working with me, tell me. I want to know.
