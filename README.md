## Management

Frameworks for developing people and running effective teams.

| Document | Description |
|:---|:---|
| [1-on-1 Framework](./management/1-on-1-framework.md) | Structured meeting format for meaningful manager-report conversations |
| [Onboarding Philosophy](./management/onboarding-philosophy.md) | 4-week high-touch immersion program with pair programming |

### Key Principles

- **Ownership over checklist** — Teams define their social fabric
- **High-touch onboarding** — 4 weeks of structured pair programming
- **Gradual autonomy** — From observation to leadership

---

## Culture

Standards and philosophies that define how we work together.

| Document | Description |
|:---|:---|
| [Engineering Standards](./culture/engineering-standards.md) | Code style, Scout Rule, blameless post-mortems, ADRs |
| [Ownership Model](./culture/ownership-model.md) | Stewardship over gatekeeping, anti-bottleneck strategies |

### Key Principles

- **Stewardship > Gatekeeping** — Owners mentor, not block
- **Automated consistency** — Let linters handle style debates
- **Blameless culture** — Systems fail, not people
- **Default to public** — Context should be searchable

---

## Technical Strategy

Governance structures for code quality and team scalability.

| Document | Description |
|:---|:---|
| [Code Guardianship](./technical-strategy/code-guardianship.md) | CODEOWNERS structure with tiered ownership |

### Key Principles

- **Clear accountability** — Every file has a defined owner
- **Appropriate expertise** — Critical paths get senior review
- **Reduced cognitive load** — Automated PR assignment
- **Safety nets** — Ship fast within guardrails

### The Goal

> **Build systems so robust and teams so informed that leadership presence is a luxury, not a requirement.**

---

## Quick Start

1. **For new managers:** Start with [1-on-1 Framework](./management/1-on-1-framework.md)
2. **For team leads:** Read [Ownership Model](./culture/ownership-model.md)
3. **For architects:** Implement [Code Guardianship](./technical-strategy/code-guardianship.md)
4. **For everyone:** Internalize [Engineering Standards](./culture/engineering-standards.md)

## About

These documents represent battle-tested approaches to engineering leadership, developed through scaling teams, shipping products, and learning from both successes and failures.

**Core beliefs:**
- Great teams are built, not hired
- Culture is what you do, not what you say
- Processes should enable, not constrain
- Documentation beats tribal knowledge
